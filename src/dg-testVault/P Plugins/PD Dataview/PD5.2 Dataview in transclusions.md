Transcluding the Dataview-containing [[PD5.1 Dataview in transclusions]] file below:
![[PD5.1 Dataview in transclusions]]

The transcluded, Dataview-containing transclusion above should have been processed as expected with the Dataview having been processed. e.g. the text and link should use the frontmatter from the original file per the Dataview queries in that file.
