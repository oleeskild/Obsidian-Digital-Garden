Welcome to the digital garden testing vault! 

This vault is part of the `obsidian-digital-garden` repository, and meant to act as a staging area for 

1. providing a maintainable testing ground for the digital garden features
2. documenting features in action 

Hopefully in the future it can be part of automated testing too! Say, snapshot testing the output from this garden would actually be relatively easy! :)
